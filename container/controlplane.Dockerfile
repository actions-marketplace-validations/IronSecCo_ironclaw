# IronClaw control-plane image (the host daemon, published to GHCR).
#
# Ships the host daemon (/usr/local/bin/ironclaw-controlplane, from cmd/controlplane)
# and the admin CLI (/usr/local/bin/ironctl, from cmd/ironctl) on a minimal
# Debian-slim rootfs. This is the image docker-compose.yml runs and the one the
# `image.yml` workflow pushes to ghcr.io/<owner>/ironclaw-controlplane on release.
#
# This image is the HOST control-plane, not a sandbox. The sandboxes it launches are
# a SEPARATE image (container/Dockerfile, cmd/sandbox) run by the gVisor isolator
# with network=none — they are never started by docker-compose and never share this
# image's network. The control-plane itself DOES have egress (host-proxied model
# calls to api.anthropic.com); that asymmetry is the whole point and must not be
# flattened (see docker-compose.yml).
#
# The entrypoint mints the admin/API token on first run (printed once, no recovery)
# unless the operator supplies IRONCLAW_API_TOKEN. The image holds NO secrets: the
# model credential and any channel tokens arrive at runtime via the environment.
#
# Build from the repository root:
#   docker build -f container/controlplane.Dockerfile -t ironclaw-controlplane:latest .

# Standard OCI source labels (IRO-633). `revision` is the git commit this image was built
# from and `source` is the repository it came from, so the image itself carries an
# independent claim about its own origin. That matters because provenance does not:
# actions/attest-build-provenance takes the subject digest as a free input and signs
# whatever it is handed, so an attestation can describe an image the run never built
# (IRO-629). These labels are baked into the image bytes at build time and are part of the
# digest, so they cannot be re-pointed after the fact the way an attestation subject can —
# which makes them a cross-check on it rather than a duplicate of it. image.yml asserts
# `revision` against the commit it trust-gated, on every published arch, before attesting.
#
# `source` additionally links the GHCR package to this repo, which is what lets consumers
# run `gh attestation verify --repo` against it at all.
