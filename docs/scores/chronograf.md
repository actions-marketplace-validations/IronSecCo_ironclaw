# chronograf:1.10 container isolation score: 48/100 (grade D)

Run with plain `docker run chronograf:1.10` defaults, no hardening flags, the **chronograf** image scores **48/100, grade D (porous)** on IronClaw's seven-dimension container containment scale. Higher is safer. This is what you get straight out of a copy-pasted `docker run`; the fixes below show where the lost points are.

> Graded from a read-only inspect of a **running container** started from `chronograf:1.10` at digest `sha256:843bf6f649de7a555aedf5a348ff962d72ae81a4dba3dacf8f91cf61fd3342c3` with plain `docker run` defaults, its entrypoint overridden with `sleep` purely to keep it alive. The scan itself executes nothing inside the container. Scoring an image reference instead of a running container yields a different, non-comparable result. [How scoring works &rarr;](../scan.md)

## How it scores, dimension by dimension

| Dimension | Verdict | Score | What the scan found |
|-----------|:-------:|------:|---------------------|
| Non-root user (uid != 0) | ❌ FAIL | 0/15 | runs as root (user "0 (default)"); a container escape starts with host-uid 0 |
| Dropped capabilities | ❌ FAIL | 4/20 | default capability set retained (includes CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_MKNOD, …) |
| Seccomp profile | ✅ PASS | 15/15 | seccomp profile active (syscall surface filtered) |
| Network isolation / egress | ⚠️ WARN | 4/15 | network=bridge: outbound egress is possible; prefer network=none |
| Read-only root filesystem | ❌ FAIL | 0/10 | root filesystem is writable: tamper/persistence surface |
| No docker.sock exposure | ✅ PASS | 15/15 | no docker.sock / OCI control socket mounted |
| No shared host namespaces | ✅ PASS | 10/10 | no host PID/IPC/network namespace sharing |

## Harden it: the highest-value fixes

Applying these to your `docker run chronograf` targets the biggest gaps first (most points at stake first):

- **Dropped capabilities**, `--cap-drop=ALL`  
  Drop every Linux capability; add back only what the workload provably needs.
- **Non-root user (uid != 0)**, `--user 65532:65532`  
  Pin a non-root uid so a container escape does not begin as host uid 0.
- **Network isolation / egress**, `--network=none`  
  Cut egress so a compromised workload cannot reach the network or exfiltrate.
- **Read-only root filesystem**, `--read-only --tmpfs /tmp`  
  Make the root filesystem read-only to remove the tamper/persistence surface.

The fixes above, plus the rest of IronClaw's recommended flag set, as one command:

```bash
docker run -d --name chronograf-hardened \
  --user 65532:65532 \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --read-only --tmpfs /tmp \
  --network=none \
  chronograf:1.10
```

This image has not been re-scanned under those flags, so this page states no hardened score for it. The one hardened run this survey measures is `nginx:1.27-alpine`, which reaches 100/100 (grade A) on exactly this flag set. Expect to adjust, and expect a ceiling: `--network=none` is not an option for a service that has to accept connections, and dropping it leaves the network-isolation dimension exactly where the table above has it. A container that writes outside `/tmp` will not boot read-only until you add a `--tmpfs` for each path it needs (some want a writable mode, e.g. `--tmpfs /data:rw,mode=1777`). Re-run `ironctl scan` on the result to see where yours actually lands.

## Scan your own container

These grades come from `ironctl scan`, a single, credential-free command that audits any running container, docker-compose service, or Kubernetes manifest, not just this image:

```bash
# install (Homebrew)
brew install ironsecco/ironclaw/ironclaw

# grade your own chronograf the same way this page was generated
ironctl scan my-chronograf
```

## Badge this image

Maintain **chronograf** (or run it)? Show its default-config isolation score with a badge that links back to this scorecard:

[![Container Isolation Score: 48/100 D](https://img.shields.io/badge/container%20isolation-48%2F100%20D-e8873a)](https://ironsecco.github.io/ironclaw/scores/chronograf/)

```

The badge is a plain [shields.io](https://shields.io) URL: no server, no build step, nothing to host. It reflects this page's default-configuration grade. Hardened your own deployment? Generate a live badge of *your* config with [`ironctl scan --badge-json`](../blog/add-a-sandbox-isolation-score-badge-to-your-repo.md), or compare every image on the [leaderboard](leaderboard.md).
