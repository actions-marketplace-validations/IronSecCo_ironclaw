# Environment variable reference

IronClaw reads the following named environment variables in its production Go
commands and packages. Keep credentials in the host process environment. The
control plane uses them to authenticate upstream requests, but does not pass them
into agent sandboxes.

An empty value has the same effect as an unset value unless a row says otherwise.
A command-line flag overrides the corresponding environment-backed default.
Boolean variables accept `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`, case-insensitively.

## Dynamically named variables

Three configuration paths can read a variable whose name is not fixed in the
source:

- `ironctl mcp serve --token-env NAME` reads `NAME` for the delegated control-plane
  token. The default name is `IRONCLAW_API_TOKEN`.
- MCP catalog values may contain `${NAME}` references. IronClaw expands them from
  the host environment when the MCP server connects.
- Each vault-injector credential names its secret variable in the config file's
  `secretEnv` field. The injector reads that variable at startup and again after an
  approved rotation.

These values remain host-side. Do not put the secret itself in an MCP catalog or a
vault-injector config file.
