# Channel adapters & their credentials

IronClaw delivers an agent's replies through **channel adapters** in
[`internal/host/channels/`](https://github.com/IronSecCo/ironclaw/tree/main/internal/host/channels). Each adapter implements a
tiny interface (`Name()` + `Deliver()`) and talks to one platform. This page is the
single reference for **what each adapter needs to be configured**.

Two things to know up front:

- **Secrets are host-only.** Every token/password below is held by the
  control-plane and never enters a sandbox. Adapters redact their own credential
  from any error string, so a token can't leak into logs.
- **How an adapter is activated.** Some adapters **auto-register from environment
  variables** when the control-plane starts (the daemon reads the var and registers
  the adapter if it's set). The rest are implemented and ready, but are wired
  programmatically / via the registry rather than from a single env var today — the
  "Auto-registered from env" column says which is which.

The adapter posts outbound messages as `{"text":"..."}` using the standard webhook endpoint.                |

> The in-product **web chat** playground (`webchat`) is registered automatically and
> needs no credential — it's the browser-based chat surface, not an external platform.

## Configuring an auto-registered adapter

Set the variable in the control-plane's environment (or in `.env` when running with
[Docker Compose](https://github.com/IronSecCo/ironclaw/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)), then start the daemon:

```sh
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...      # registers the Discord adapter on boot
# the daemon logs: channel adapter registered  adapter=discord
```

Then wire it to an agent group with the registry — see
[`examples/`](https://github.com/IronSecCo/ironclaw/tree/main/examples) for runnable templates and the
[CLI reference](https://github.com/IronSecCo/ironclaw/blob/main/README.md) for `ironctl registry`.

## Adding a new adapter

Want a platform that isn't here yet? See
[**Writing a channel adapter**](writing-a-channel-adapter.md) for the interface, the
house pattern (stdlib HTTP, test-overridable `BaseURL`, secret redaction, threading),
and the test pattern.
